# Abalone-Age-Prediction

## Overview
The analysis "Predicting the Age of Abalones," focuses on advanced regression modeling to estimate abalone age from physical measurements. The project uses a dataset of 4177 samples, applying log-transformed regression models for enhanced accuracy.

## Project Description
- **Objective**: To determine how the number of rings on the shell of the abalone depends on the other variables in the data. 
- **Methodology**: In-depth data analysis, development of multiple regression models, and refinement of models for accuracy.
- **Significance**: Offers a non-invasive method for determining the age of abalones, crucial in marine biology and fisheries management.
